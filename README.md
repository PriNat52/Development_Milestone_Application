# Development_Milestone_Application

# Project Direction Overview

  The plan is to develop an application which helps with guidance for parents/guardians by tracking growth milestones for their children named as “Milestone”. This application will contain five major sections such as

1. Growth Milestone - This section will be the main profile page for handling all the input datas from the user such as age of the child, vaccination updates and so on.

2. Development Milestone - This section will have four main categories which will automatically update according to the age of the child given in the profile. The four main categories are cognitive, language, physical and emotional milestone updates.

3. Alerts - This section will contain doctor appointment alerts, reminders for vaccinations that are due for the child and (only in some cases) footnote notifications if the child is showing any signs of red flag(delays in growth).

4. Pediatric Consultations - This section will contain available online staff for attending immediate consultations and chat message options for the parents to directly contact the pediatric doctor.

5. Forum - Tips/Experience with the child can be shared with the public or group of audience using this app and interaction between them.

  Brief example on someone using this application. The parent/guardian Liza installs this app and when she opens this app it prompts her to fill in the growth details of her 1 year old child Jay. After all the main inputs of Jay are accepted in the database, the development milestone section is ready with all the milestone details appropriate for the age of 1 year olds is filtered and displayed in all four milestone categories. As for the third section, Liza can update and edit alerts for further appointments and reminders. In the fourth section assuming the permission granted for accessing details with the pediatrician, the details of Jay’s pediatrician and pediatric groups will be updated for emergency contacts.

My interest in developing such an application is because I always enjoy keeping track of the growth details of my kids. As an early education teacher and my experiences during conferences with parents, they appreciate more when teachers educate children appropriately for their age and with this type of application I believe parents/guardians can have more exposure to how to bond and educate their child with ease.
